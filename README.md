# Probing BERT for Bridging
This repository contains code for our paper "Probing for Bridging Inference in Transformer Language Models", Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2021 (NAACL 2021).

** To run the experiment **
1. Python version 3.3
2. To get pretrained BERT, huggingface transformer library is used.
3. Experiments are run on ISNotes dataset which can be obtained freely from the web.
4. All the experiments are present in bert_analysis.py
